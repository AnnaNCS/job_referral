Job Referral Program

In order to run the program, run the following files in your terminal:

~ % gcc main.c vector.c pair.c graph_node.c\n
~ % ./a.out

The program will ask the user for input. Two names represent a source and a target. The program will look in the data file provided for the first name, being the source, and the second one being the target. It will then build a pathway between the two, representing the connections of people between them.

The input should be in the following format:
Firstname,Secondname

Each name has to start with a capital letter (just like it is represented in the data file), the two names have to be divided with a comma, and the input should not contain any spaces. 

The program will keep asking for input until the user will type 'quit' into the input.
